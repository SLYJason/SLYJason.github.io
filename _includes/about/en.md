Hi, my name is Luyi Song, a software engineer working for [Comcast](https://my.xfinity.com/). My interests mainly includes computer science fundamentals (algorithm, data structure, operating system), software architecture and mordern web development. 

I started learning code in 2016 and I fell in loving writing code since then. What I love the most is I can solve real world problems through coding and help humans to build fantastic products. Now, I'm on the way to become a [Competitive Programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming), it's a long journey since I'm still learning a lot of CS fundamentals. Just like the proverb: Rome wasn't built in a day, but as long as you study hard and be patient, it will come true one day.

The reason why I started to write the tech blog is I want to find a place to write down what I have learned during my daily work and share my few thoughts on this. Although most of the answers can be found using [Google](https://www.google.com/) or [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), but it does not mean you can understand this knowledge in that way, you have to come up with your own solution.
